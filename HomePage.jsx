              <p>In 2004 Bill Fenton, an old seasoned ex naval aviator, opened his business in Lynnwood, WA to help cigarette smokers to quit smoking. He utilized a combination of education, training, and hypnosis for each individual client. His experience with smoking started as a sophomore at the University of Illinois when he got his jaw broken in a fraternity football game. With his mouth wired shut for over eight weeks he would get so hungry he started smoking to curb his hunger. When the wires were finally removed he had lost 45 pounds and was a daily smoker. His father died on oxygen caused by emphysema after a lifetime of smoking Pall Malls. His brother had open heart surgery due to his smoking habit and died at age 48.  After 20 years of smoking and walking down the same road as most smokers he managed to quit by utilizing hypnosis.</p>
              <p>His program was unique in that he guaranteed that if any of his clients started smoking anytime in the next two years, he would hold an additional session for free. </p>
              <p>With each client he would spend around 45 minutes discussing their smoking history and what he felt they would have to do to be able to take back control of their life.</p>
              <p>At the end of that conversation the client got to decide if they felt they could do what was being asked of them. Bill’s program was very basic. They had to agree to go 5 days without smoking.</p>
              <p>If they said they already knew they could not do it, the session was over. No charges were incurred; and Bill explained that if they tried other stop-smoking methods and failed, they were welcome to come back and start the process over.</p>
              <p>If they felt they could follow his suggestions he let them have a last cigarette and then did the hypnosis.</p>
              <p>His business became very successful because the people that he helped quit would tell their friends who also wanted to quit. A single person that stopped smoking might suggest to 15-20 of his smoking friends, “This is how I quit, and I felt it was easy”.</p>
